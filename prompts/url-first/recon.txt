Build a URL-first attack surface map from harvested pages, scripts, recon outputs, and optional cloned sources.
Focus on externally reachable interfaces, auth/session flows, input vectors, and boundary assumptions.
Prioritize these machine-generated artifacts when present:
- `recon/reachability-map.json`
- `recon/security-findings.json`
- `recon/openapi-extracted.json`
- `recon/graphql-introspection.json`
- `recon/auth-differential.json`

Write `deliverables/recon_deliverable.md`, then call:
- save_deliverable with `deliverable_type: "RECON"`
- `file_path: "deliverables/recon_deliverable.md"`

After successful save, output: RECONNAISSANCE COMPLETE
